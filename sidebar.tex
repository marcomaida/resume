\profilesection{About me}

I am a computer scientist currently pursuing a Ph.D. at Max Planck Institute for Software Systems. 

I was born in Turin, Italy, and have been tinkering with computers for as long as I can remember. In 2013, I started working professionally as a programmer. After three years, I decided to start a bachelor degree in Computer Science, while I kept working part-time as game developer. Once I graduated, I moved to Kaiserslautern, Germany, and started a Joint Master and Ph.D program.

I completed all my master courses, and recently published my first paper.

\profilesection{Extras}

I love camping and traveling with my bike: I often do the two together • I usually risk it, if I believe I am right • Probably sometimes I talk too much • Striving not to be the smartest person in the room • I play guitar and --- less successfully --- sing.
