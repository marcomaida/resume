\profilesection{About me}

I was born in Turin, Italy, and have been tinkering with computers for as long as
I can remember. 

I started working professionally as a developer in 2013. After three years, I started working as game developer while studying part-time as a bachelor's student.

Once I graduated, I moved to Germany and started a joint master's and Ph.D. program. In 2022 I completed my Master's program and first-authored a research paper. 

I am currently in New York, interning at Bloomberg LP.

\profilesection{Trivia}

I love camping and traveling with my bike: I often do the two together • I usually risk it, if I believe I am right • I love simplicity • I am striving not to be the smartest person in the room • I often relax by walking on a tensioned rope • I play guitar and --- less successfully --- sing.
