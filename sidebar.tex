\profilesection{About me}

I am a computer scientist currently pursuing a PhD at Max Planck Institute for Software Systems. 

I was born in Turin, Italy, and have been tinkering with computers since I have memory. In 2013, I started working professionally as a programmer. After three years, I decided to start a bachelor degree in Computer Science, while I kept working part-time as game developer. Once I graduated, I moved to Kaiserslautern, Germany, and started a Master+PhD program.

I completed all my master courses.
