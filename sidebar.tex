\profilesection{About me}

I was born in Turin, Italy, and have been tinkering with computers for as long as
I can remember. 

I started working professionally as a developer in 2013. After three years, I started a bachelor degree in Computer Science, while I kept working part-time as game developer.

Once I graduated, I moved to Germany, and started a Joint Master and Ph.D. program. 
After completing my Master’s program, publishing my first research paper, and doing an R\&D internship in U.S., I decided to suspend my Ph.D. and return to industry.

und ich spreche etwas \textbf{Deutsch}.

\profilesection{Extras}

I love camping and traveling with my bike: I often do the two together • I usually risk it, if I believe I am right • Striving not to be the smartest person in the room • I play guitar and --- less successfully --- sing.
