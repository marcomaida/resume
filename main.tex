\section{Skills}

I have nine years of professional experience in writing code. I am fluent in writing \textbf{Python}, \textbf{C\#}, \textbf{C++}, \textbf{C}, \textbf{Java}, \textbf{Rust} and \textbf{Coq} code. During my seven years in the \textbf{industry}, I learnt to work on big code bases in large and small teams.

Two years in \textbf{research} taught me how study complicated problems and then design, implement, evaluate, document and finally present my solutions.

I am very \textbf{outgoing} and I \textbf{love working in teams}. Thanks to my experience in game development, I am used to collaborate with different professional figures and I have an eye for \textbf{user experience}.\\

\section{Experience}

\begin{twenty} % Environment for a list with descriptions
	\twentyitem{since 2019}{Computer Science Researcher.}{Max Planck Institute}{ I am currently working on Real-time Systems. My work is focused on timeliness certifications in safety-critical systems using formal verification (Coq) and on trace-based schedulability analysis on Linux.}
	\twentyitem{2016-2019}{Game developer.}{34BigThings}{ I worked with Unity3D (C\#)  and Unreal Engine (C++) on single player and online multiplayer games shipped on Steam, PS4, XboxOne, Nintendo Switch and mobiles. I developed gameplays, AIs, tools and UIs.}
	\twentyitem{2016}{Freelance Unity3D developer.}{Teoresi, Choralia, Maserati}{
		I built an interactive visualization software and a learning game using Unity3D. I shipped on mobile devices and browsers.
	}
	\twentyitem{2013-2016}{Software engineer.}{R.O. srl}{
		I worked as a developer using C, C++, C\# and SQL building solutions for glass processing factories. I covered many roles, including traveling to customers to sell, install and teach our software.

\section{Projects}

\begin{twenty} % Environment for a list with descriptions
	\twentyitem{2021}{Poet - Automatic Proof Generation}{Max Planck institute}{ I developed a tool that, given time data about a real-time system, produces machine-checked proofs bounding the worst-case scenario response time of each component of the system. An ongoing work publication has been recently accepted at RTSS2021, one of the top-class conferences for real-time systems.  }
	\twentyitem{2018}{Fast Mobile Cycle (FMC) Framework and Toolkit.}{34BigThings}{ 
		I developed a Unity3D framework make the creation of production-ready casual games extremely fast, paired by a Python toolkit to execute bulk operations on the FMC games.
		With FMC, I, an artist, and a designer, developed ten production-ready games within a month.

	 }
	 \twentyitem{2017}{Razer Chroma in Unreal Engine 4.}{34BigThings}{ 
		I developed a framework that handles light effects on Razer's Chroma hardware that are coherent to what is happening in the game. This system is still used today in every 34BigThings game.

%\subsection{Review}
%
%Alice approaches Wonderland as an anthropologist, but maintains a strong sense of noblesse oblige that comes with her class status. She has confidence in her social position, education, and the Victorian virtue of good manners. Alice has a feeling of entitlement, particularly when comparing herself to Mabel, whom she declares has a ``poky little house," and no toys. Additionally, she flaunts her limited information base with anyone who will listen and becomes increasingly obsessed with the importance of good manners as she deals with the rude creatures of Wonderland. Alice maintains a superior attitude and behaves with solicitous indulgence toward those she believes are less privileged.
