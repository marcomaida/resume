With over \textbf{ten years of professional experience}, I specialize in designing and implementing systems that tackle complex problems at scale. My expertise spans both research and engineering, with a strong foundation in \textbf{C++}, \textbf{Rust}, \textbf{C}, \textbf{Python}, \textbf{C\#}, and \textbf{Coq}. 
Currently based in \textbf{London}, I work as a \textbf{Tech Lead} at \textbf{Wayve}, leading the inference performance team for Wayve's autonomous vehicle stack.
