\section{Skills}

I have nine years of professional experience in writing code. I am fluent in writing \textbf{Python}, \textbf{C\#}, \textbf{C++}, \textbf{C}, \textbf{Java}, \textbf{Rust} and \textbf{Coq} code. During my seven years in the \textbf{industry}, I learn to work on big code bases in large and small teams.

Having spent two years in \textbf{research}, I can study complicated problems and then design, implement, evaluate, document and finally present my solutions.

I am very \textbf{outgoing} and, in my experience, I do well in teams. Being a relevant part of my career in game development, I am used to collaborate with different professional figures and over time I developed a good sense of \textbf{aesthetics}.\\

\section{Other Projects}

\begin{twenty} % Environment for a list with descriptions
	\twentyitem{2018}{Fast Mobile Cycle (FMC) Framework and Toolkit.}{}{ 
		I developed an open-source Unity3D framework to quickly develop production-ready mobile games. The framework restricts the game type to infinite-runners, but imposes no restriction on the actual gameplay, and automatically handles data persistence, ads, analytics, and a leveling system. Complementary to this, I developed a Python toolkit to automate the creation and updating of the FMC games.   
		With a small team composed of me, an artist, and a designer, we developed ten production-ready games within a month. \small \url{(www.github.com/34OpenThings)}\normalfont
	 }
	 \twentyitem{2017}{Razer Chroma in Unreal Engine 4.}{}{ 
		I developed a framework that connects gameplay with Razer's Chroma devices, used today in every 34BigThings game.

%\subsection{Review}
%
%Alice approaches Wonderland as an anthropologist, but maintains a strong sense of noblesse oblige that comes with her class status. She has confidence in her social position, education, and the Victorian virtue of good manners. Alice has a feeling of entitlement, particularly when comparing herself to Mabel, whom she declares has a ``poky little house," and no toys. Additionally, she flaunts her limited information base with anyone who will listen and becomes increasingly obsessed with the importance of good manners as she deals with the rude creatures of Wonderland. Alice maintains a superior attitude and behaves with solicitous indulgence toward those she believes are less privileged.
